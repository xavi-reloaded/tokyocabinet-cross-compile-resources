Major changes in release 1.6.3

* Support for Autoconf-2.59.

Major changes in release 1.6.1

* Fix typo in m4/sockinttypes.m4.
  configure exits with an error message if it fails to get size of
  `sin_port' in `struct sockaddr_in' or `sa_family' in `struct sockaddr'.

Major changes in release 1.6

* Support for RFC3493.
  Add `sin6_flowinfo' and `sin6_scope_id' to `struct sockaddr_in6'.
* Check sizes of `in_port_t' and `sa_family_t' strictly.

Major changes in release 1.5.1

* Fix typo in getaddrinfo.c.
  Fix declaration of the `h_errno' external variable.

Major changes in release 1.5

* Add `in_port_t' and `sa_family_t' supports.
* `m4/socklent.m4' is renamed to `m4/sockinttypes.h'.
* `m4/structin6addr.h' is renamed to `m4/in6addr.h'.

Major changes in release 1.4

* getnameinfo() returns EAI_OVERFLOW not EAI_MEMORY when a given buffer
  doesn't have enough space.

Major changes in release 1.3.1

* No major change.

Major changes in release 1.3

* No major change.

Major changes in release 1.2

* getaddrinfo() returns EAI_MEMORY rather than EAI_SYSTEM when malloc()
  is failed.
* getaddrinfo() checks IP address strictly.
* getaddrinfo() now works correctly on systems that they have gethostname()
  which cannot resolve an IP address.

Major changes in release 1.1

* gai_strerror() now returns `const char *', not `char *'.
* EAI_ADDRFAMILY and EAI_OVERFLOW are defined.
* A bug in NLS handling in gai_strerror() is fixed.
* AI_, NI_ and EAI_ macros are undefined and then redefined again,
  if they are defined in `netdb.h'.
* The package now works on systems that they has either either getaddrinfo()
  or getnameinfo().
